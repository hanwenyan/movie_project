Udacity Movie Project

This is the project for the Programming Foundations with Python which introduces Object Oriented Programming for students. The goal here is create a simple website which displays movie trailers of the student's favorite movies as well as some of the movie information.

Changelog:
6/1/15 - Initial commit. Changes from original fresh_tomatoes.py and media.py (replaced by omdbiapi.py) include: 
* Data pulls from www.omdbapi.com so that I don't have to entire a bunch of information for each movie instance. It still requires a YT link.
* Added jQuery / HTML for having a modal pop-up with movie information

Requirements:
- Python 2.7

To run:
Download and unzip the project folder and run:
`python entertainment_center_omdbapi.py`
