## Changelog:

### 6/2/15 - More updates:
* Added more comments to code and cleaned up some javascript
* Added a footer to reference and link to OMDb where the movie information is retrieved
* Added more movie information to the class Movie, including director, actors, movie scores, and linked to IMDb

### 6/1/15 - Changes from original fresh_tomatoes.py and media.py (replaced by omdbiapi.py) include: 
* Data pulls from www.omdbapi.com so that I don't have to enter all of the information manually for each movie instance. It still requires a YT link for each movie.
* Added jQuery / HTML for having a modal pop-up with movie information
